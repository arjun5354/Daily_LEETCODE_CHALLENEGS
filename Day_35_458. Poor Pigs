//Approach-1
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int T = minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1;

        int pigs = 0;

        while(pow(T, pigs) < buckets) {
            pigs++;
        }


        return pigs;

        
    }
};

//Approach-2 (Using simple one liner)
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        //(T+1)^pigs = buckets
        //pigs = log(buckets)/log(T+1)

        return ceil(log2(buckets)/log2(minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1));

        
    }
